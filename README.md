# Overview

**DISCLAIMER**: Due to privacy and data sharing agreements, the data referenced in all code in this repo cannot be shared. Due to privacy concerns, the results generated by the code cannot be shared.

This repo contains a sample analysis I performed as a Research Analyst at the
University of Chicago [Crime Lab](https://crimelab.uchicago.edu/). The analysis employs data from the Chicago Police Department (CPD) and the [Homelessness Management Information System](https://www.hudexchange.info/programs/hmis/) (HMIS) to study homelessness rates of individuals arrested on drug charges before and after their arrest. You can find a description of each task in this repo
below.

# Task Descriptions

This repo contains two tasks. In order:

1. `create_table`: calculates homelessness rate before and after arrest, within one year, for a CPD arrests-level sample of drug arrests. Produces a simple table with one row for arrest timing (before or after arrest) and columns describing homelessness rate. Homelessness information is provided by HMIS and the HMIS and CPD data are linked using the University of Chicago's [namematch](https://github.com/urban-labs/namematch) tool for probabilistic record linkage.

2. `plot_event_study`: plots homelessness rate as a function of time elapsed before and after an individual's arrest, up to a year prior to arrest and a year post-arrest. Time is measured in 30 day intervals, so that $t = 0$ on the x-axis corresponds to 0 to 30 days, inclusive, after an individual's arrest.
